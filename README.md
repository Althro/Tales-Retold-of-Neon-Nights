## Preamble

> "You can't know Night City well, ever. It's always changin', always surprisin'. Part of its charm." -V

Tales of the Neon Nights (TotNN) is a list that slightly shifts Cyberpunk to have a more retro feel and experience. From visuals by [FUNKED](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3914) to sound by [Maestros of Synth](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3776), the world will feel different and respond differently with [Enhanced Netrunner AI](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2468) and [Reduced Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2678).

## System Requirements

I highly recommend trying these [optimisation steps](https://exputer.com/guides/best-cyberpunk-2077-pc-settings-for-high-fps/) to make sure you're playing at a framerate you find comfortable. For AMD cards that support Raytracing, I recommend not using RT as whilst it does look nice, it will destroy your FPS (I lost 50fps with it on).

Space required: Approx 2.7GB

## Installation

Installing TotNN is relatively easy and, if you have nexus premium, will be a simple waiting game. If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the [updating section](#updating).

### Pre-Installation

Prior to installing TotNN, please complete the following steps.

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) 
2. Ensure that Cyberpunk is installed to a location such as C:\Games or similar. **Failure to ensure this may result in certain scripted mods not working**
3. Run the REDLauncher as Administrator once. This is to ensure that the game is able to run properly.

### Wabbajack Installation

#### Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack]((https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. **Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder.** I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

#### Downloading and Installing TotNN

Downloading and installing TotNN shoould be relatively quick as it is not that large (less than 1GB in fact). To install, complete the following steps.

1. Download the latest installer from [releases](https://github.com/Althro/Tales-of-the-Neon-Nights/releases) tab. Move it to a location such as C:\Games.
2. Open Wabbajack and click on install from disk.
3. Select the file you just downloaded called `Tales of the Neon Nights.wabbajack`.
4. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\TotNN. **Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.** The downloads folder will autofill.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. Go and pet your nearest fluffy animal whilst Wabbajack does its thing.
7. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [post installation](#post-installation). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

##### Problems with installation

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

- Could not download x:
	- Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.

- x is not a whitelisted download:

	 - This will happen when I update the modlist. Please check if there is a new update or wait until you see a release ping.

- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

	- Either buy the game or go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

- Antivirus reports a virus:
	- Windows 10/11 may automatically quarantine a key file which is needed for Mod Organizer. You can fix this by [adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in windows defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).

## Post-Installation

### Game Folder

In order for TotNN to work properly, you will need to copy some files into your game folder. Once the installation has finished, complete the following:

1. Press the open installation folder button.
2. Open the folder called `Game Folder Files` and copy the `bin` folder.
3. Paste this folder into your Cyberpunk2077 directory.

## Playing the List

### Starting up the list
Open the installation folder and double click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. Once launched, make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `Cyberpunk 2077` and press the run button.

## Updating the modlist

Before updating, please check the changelog and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the `overwrite existing modlist` button. **Note**: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating.

## Removing the Modlist
Simply delete the folder and you have uninstalled it.
